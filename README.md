# CPP-SwordFight
First GitHub repository. Uploading my first C++ project on here, a small text-based sword-fighting game.
I wrote the whole thing in one day (this very day) so it's not that complex, but still pretty fun to mess around with.
Runs in your console, you'll have to use the makefile first though to make an executable. It's built for Linux.
